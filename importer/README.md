## WBC_Importer Extension - One Click Demo Importer ##
One Click Multi Demo Content Importer Extension for [ReduxFramework](https://github.com/ReduxFramework/redux-framework)

For issues or questions please post in [issues](https://github.com/Webcreations907/WBC-Importer-extension/issues) here and __not__ on Reduxframework issue tracker. Thanks :smile:

This is a modified version of [Radium Importer](https://github.com/FrankM1/radium-one-click-demo-install) to work as a extension for ReduxFramework and support multiple demo imports.

## Steps ##
__1__- Download code from this repo, unzip and place ```wbc_importer``` folder into your Redux [extensions directory](http://reduxframework.com/docs/extensions-loader/ "Redux Documentation"). 
_After this you should see the demo importer load in your Theme Options panel with a few examples showing._

__2__- Inside ```wbc_importer/demo-data/``` create a demo content folder. IE __demo1__, __demo2__, __etc__. 

__3__- Create ```content.xml``` file by exporting your WordPress content using the WordPress's export function __tools > export__

__4__- _(optional)_ Create a ```widgets.txt``` file using [Widget Importer & Exporter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/) plugin. It will export as ```.wie``` file, just rename file to ```widgets.txt```

__5__- _(optional)_ Create ```theme-options.txt``` file, get content from your __Import/Export__ of your Redux panel.

__6__- Create a ```320x240``` screenshot image called ```screen-image.jpg```, supports .png,.gif as well.

__7__- __That's All!__ Repeat steps __2-6__ for each demo content set/import you want.
